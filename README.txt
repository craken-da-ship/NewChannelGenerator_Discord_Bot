Welcome to the Channel Generator!

This is used to allow users to create one voice channel and/or one text channel.
They are only able to do this once and then they will be blacklisted from the bot command.

To create channels run these commands:
For Text
	/NewText channelname
For Voice
	/NewVoice channelname

Make sure to change your token on the NewChannelGenerator.py at the very bottom.
If you wish to change the names of any of the blacklist files, make sure that you update
the names in the program as well.
